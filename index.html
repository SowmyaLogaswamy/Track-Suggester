    <p class="paragraph">As we know, students must decide which track they would like to pursue before they enroll. While all languages have similarities, and switching between languages and platforms is very common in both internships and jobs, applicants should still choose the track they wish to complete with care.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Currently, our academy offers several tracks in Seattle and Portland. Before you enroll just answer these questions and know the right track that best suits you.</p>
